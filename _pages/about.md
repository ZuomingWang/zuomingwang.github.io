I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from both [Guangdong Technion - Israel Institite of Technology (China)](https://gtiit.technion.ac.il) and [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (Israel)](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/). I had the good fortune of doing research in hydrogen retention, spintronics, molecular electronics and hydrogels.
